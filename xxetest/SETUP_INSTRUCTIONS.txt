Make sure you have Java and Maven installed! If you want to run different Java verions, be sure to set your %JAVA_HOME% and %PATH% variables accordingly.
(Note: Earlier Java versions may give errors if incompatible with certain XXE fixes)

To run test cases out of the command line:

	- Run mvnTestReport.bat or mvnTestReport.sh

To run test cases out of a web browser:

	- Run mvnDeployWebApp.bat or mvnDeployWebApp.sh

	- Press Ctrl-C in the command line when done and then terminate the batch job

To run test cases with Contrast:

	- Place your contrast.jar file in the base directory (xxetest)
	- Run mvnDeployWebAppWithContrast.bat or mvnDeployWebAppWithContrast.sh
	- When it gets to "[INFO] Press Ctrl-C to stop the container...", open the XXETestWebApp URL shortcut (or navigate to http://localhost:8080/xxetest)
	- You should see the app running in Contrast

NOTE: The custom jar files in the lib folder remove the META-INF/services folder that the respective libraries use to override methods that exist in other test cases.
