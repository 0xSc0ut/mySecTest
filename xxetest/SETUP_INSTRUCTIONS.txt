Make sure you have Java and Maven installed! If you want to run different Java verions, be sure to set your %JAVA_HOME% and %PATH% variables accordingly.
(Note: Earlier Java versions may give errors if incompatible with certain XXE fixes)

To run test cases out of the command line:

	- Run mvnTestReport.bat or mvnTestReport.sh

To run test cases out of a web browser:

	- Run mvnDeployWebApp.bat or mvnDeployWebApp.sh
	- When it gets to "[INFO] Press Ctrl-C to stop the container...", open the XXETestWebApp URL shortcut (or navigate to http://localhost:8080/xxetest)
	- Press Ctrl-C in the command line when done and then terminate the batch job

To run test cases with Contrast:

	- Place your contrast.jar file in the base directory (xxetest)
	- Run mvnDeployWebAppWithContrast.bat or mvnDeployWebAppWithContrast.sh
	- When it gets to "[INFO] Press Ctrl-C to stop the container...", open the XXETestWebApp URL shortcut (or navigate to http://localhost:8080/xxetest)
	- You should see the app running in Contrast
	- Press Ctrl-C in the command line when done and then terminate the batch job

NOTE: XOM's dependencies had conflicts with many other parser test cases. 
In order to get all other test cases working, some of XOM's dependencies were excluded in the pom.xml file.
In order to run all XOM test cases properly, comment out the exclusions in the XOM dependency (this will break several other test cases).
